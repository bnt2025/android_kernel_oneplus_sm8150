# Intro

This is a fork of arter97's kernel for the OnePlus 7 family of devices. I needed a kernel with the QCA-CLD driver compiled with monitor mode enabled.  

## Usage

Tol download and install the various dependancies require to build the kernel.  
- `bash ./build_env.sh`

To actually build the kernel use;
- `bash ./build_master.sh -j$(nproc)`

This will spit out a `.zip` that can be flashed using TWRP.

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
